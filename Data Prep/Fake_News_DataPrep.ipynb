ago\\napril, 1984. 13:00. comrade 6079, winston smith, thinks a thought, starts a diary, and falls in love. but big brother is always watching. set in a world where an invasive government keeps a malevolently watchful eye on its citizens, this radical and much-lauded staging explores surveillance, identity and why orwell?s vision of the future is as relevant now as ever. now with a brand new australian cast, we bring adapter-directors robert icke and duncan macmillan?s thrilling vision back to australia for a national tour.\\n\\nthere was no crystal ball, no religious apparitions or voices from the dead when george orwell wrote nineteen eighty-four, accurately depicted our present almost 70 years ago.\\n\\nit’s no coincidence that orwell’s 1949 novel had climbed back into multiple bestseller lists this year — people have realised its scarily accurate foretelling.\\n\\nin 2013 its relevance — still strong and worryingly reliable — led to the west end smash hit adaptation of the book, which is currently showing in australia.\\n\\nthe book is one of the greatest dystopian novels every written. it looks at a future where people are controlled into what to think, how to act and how to live by the government known as big brother. it uses telescreens, fearmongering, media control and corruption to control the masses. the main protagonist is the initially apathetic winston who craves something more than the controlled world he inhabits.\\n\\ncorey mcmahon, the associate director of the 1984 production in australia, said the book’s reach and resonance will always continue as it speaks to more than a literary audience.\\n\\n“it speaks to a world filled with unpopular policies and world leaders,” mcmahon said.\\n\\nthe production takes a deeper look into some of the core themes of the novel such as governmental surveillance through the subconscious co-operation of the public through their screens. you are reading this very line on one of your ‘screens’.\\n\\nmcmahon said the production looks to act as a sort of catalyst for its audiences to look at the world in a different light. to question what is true and what isn’t, to look beyond the political spin.\\n\\n“we are so busy facebooking, snapchatting, tweeting etc that we are missing what is happening in the world,” he said.\\n\\nhe pointed to a quote from the production he said not only sticks out to him every time, but one that he think will challenge audiences to really think about the world they inhabit and how they chose to be a part of it.\\n\\nthe line is from one of the characters that works for the government, otherwise known as big brother. he says: “the people will not revolt. they will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what’s happening.”\\n\\norwell didn’t have a crystal ball, what he did have was an understanding of the human condition and its weakness. apathy.\\n\\n1984 is holding shows across australia. you can purchase tickets here. theater review: \\'1984\\'\\nearly this year, sales of george orwell\\'s novel \"1984\" spiked after the words \"alternative facts\" entered the lexicon. and soon after, it was announced that a celebrated stage version in the u.k. would come to the u.s. it opened on broadway on thursday night. ny1\\'s roma torre filed the following review.\\n\\nit is truly frightening to see the parallels between george orwell\\'s dystopian novel \"1984\" and the state of our union today.\\n\\norwell wrote of \"doublethink\" and \"newspeak.\" we have alternate facts and fake news.\\n\\nof course, we\\'re not ruled by an authoritarian big brother figure — at least not yet — but robert icke and duncan macmillan\\'s harrowing stage adaptation leaves little doubt we are being watched.\\n\\nthis is not an easy play for us to watch. icke and macmillan, who also co-directed, employ disorienting effects: light and sound disruptions mess with our heads, the story seems to jump back and forth in non-linear fashion, and the torture sequence at the end is brutally graphic.\\n\\norwell\\'s disturbing tale, written nearly 70 years ago, envisioned a future without history or objective truth. the only facts that exist are the ones determined by big brother and the party. and so the mantra becomes \"ignorance is strength. war is peace. freedom is slavery.\"\\n\\nattempting to resist is winston, a young functionary who falls in love with julia. together, meeting in a secret room without a watchful tele-screen, they plan their rebellion. of course, big brother is watching and they are captured. what follows is the stuff of nightmares, and this is not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nthere is a very unsettling quality to the performances, and deliberately so. tom sturridge\\'s winston and olivia wilde as julia are clearly in love, but outwardly their emotions are muted. they are products of a world without basic humanity.\\n\\nsturridge plays winston as something of an everyman, channeling the desperation we all feel when liberty is curtailed. wilde, making her broadway debut, is equally compelling. and the always superlative reed birney is terrifyingly impassive as the torturer o\\'brien.\\n\\nperhaps most terrifying of all is hearing o\\'brien seeming to predict our current state of apathy, saying, \"the people will not revolt. they will not look up from their screens long enough to notice what\\'s happening.\" in 2017, \"1984\" resonates louder than ever. almeida\\ntheatre includes: romeo & juliet (headlong); translations;
